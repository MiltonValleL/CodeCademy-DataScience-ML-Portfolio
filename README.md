# 🎓 CodeCademy Professional Specialization: Data Science & AI
### *Mastering Machine Learning Systems & Statistical Inference*

Welcome to my central repository for all professional projects completed through **CodeCademy**. This space documents my transition from foundational data analysis to becoming a **Machine Learning Specialist**, combining the intensive structure of Bootcamps with the specialized tracks of the Career Path.

---

## 🎯 The Mission
My journey is defined by a "Mastery over Calendar" approach. Each project here isn't just a requirement; it's an opportunity to apply **Production-Ready Python**, **Rigorous Statistics**, and **Advanced ML Architectures** to solve real-world problems.

## 🏛️ Repository Architecture

This portfolio is divided into two main strategic areas:

### 1️⃣ [Bootcamp Portfolio](./Bootcamp)
*Focus: Intensive foundational projects and end-to-end data science workflows.*
* **Key Highlight:** [Predicting House Prices](./Bootcamp/predicting-house-prices) - A deep dive into Linear Regression and forensic EDA.
* **Key Highlight:** [King County Housing Price Prediction](./Bootcamp/king-county-housing-price-prediction) - Regularized Linear Models (Lasso/Ridge).
* **Key Highlight:** [Spotify Vibe Clustering](./Bootcamp/spotify-vibe-clustering) - Categorize music tracks into distinct vibes or clusters.
* **Key Highlight:** [NN Clasification of Handwritten Letters](./Bootcamp/nn_classification_of_handwritten_letters) - Neural network that clasify handwritten letters (EMNIST dataset).


### 2️⃣ [Platform Projects](./Platform-Projects)
*Focus: Specialized assignments from the **Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist** career path.*
* **Ongoing Study:** Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Deep Learning implementations.
* *Note: First specialized project arriving in Late January 2026.*

## 🧠 Core Competencies (ML Specialist Path)

By integrating both Bootcamp and Platform curricula, I am developing a high-level command of:

* **Advanced ML Models:** Implementation of Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
* **Statistical Backbone:** Deep understanding of p-values, confidence intervals, and Bayesian logic applied to ML.
* **Feature Engineering:** Advanced techniques for data transformation and dimensionality reduction.
* **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch/RandomSearch) and rigorous cross-validation.

## 🤝 Let's Connect & Grow
I am an advocate for **transparent learning**. I believe in showing the process, the iterations, and the continuous improvements of every model I build.
