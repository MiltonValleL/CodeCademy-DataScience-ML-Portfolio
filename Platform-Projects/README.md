# 🧪 Machine Learning Specialist: Platform Projects
### *Specialized Implementations & Advanced Algorithms*

This directory is dedicated to the projects assigned within the **Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist** Career Path on CodeCademy. Unlike the foundational bootcamp projects, these assignments focus on deep-dive implementations of specific algorithms and advanced AI concepts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
In this section, I am documenting my progress in:
* **Supervised Learning:** Classification, Regression, and Ensemble Methods.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA).
* **Deep Learning:** Building and tuning Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Specialized Topics:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recommendation Systems.

## 🛠️ Methodology
Each project in this folder follows a rigorous **Senior-level workflow**:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and statistical anomalies.
2.  **Model Selection:** Justifying the choice of algorithm based on data characteristics.
3.  **Optimization:** Systematic hyperparameter tuning.
4.  **Evaluation:** Using professional metrics (F1-Score, ROC-AUC, RMSE) beyond simple accuracy.
